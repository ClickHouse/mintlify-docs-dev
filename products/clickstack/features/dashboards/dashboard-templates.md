ClickStack includes a library of pre-built dashboard templates that give you instant visibility into common infrastructure and application metrics.

## Browsing available templates

To browse the built-in template library, navigate to **Dashboards** and click **Browse dashboard templates**.

This opens the template gallery, where templates are organized by category. Click **Import** to begin the import flow for that template.

## Importing a template

To import a template, a data source must be set for each dashboard visualization. Select a data source from the dropdown for each visualization, then click `Finish Import`.

## Pre-built templates

### OTel runtime metrics

The built-in OTel Runtime Metrics templates are designed for applications instrumented with [OpenTelemetry runtime metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/).

| Template                | Description                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **.NET Runtime Metrics** | GC collections, heap size, thread pool usage, and assembly counts for .NET applications                 |
| **Go Runtime Metrics**   | Goroutine counts, GC pause times, heap usage, and memory stats for Go applications                     |
| **JVM Runtime Metrics**  | Heap and non-heap memory, GC duration, thread counts, and class loading for JVM-based applications     |
| **Node.js Runtime Metrics** | Event loop delay, heap usage, CPU utilization, and V8 memory for Node.js applications               |

Notes:

- Each template is configured with a [custom filter](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/features/dashboards#custom-filters) for services which have the [`telemetry.sdk.language`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/telemetry/#telemetry-sdk-language) resource attribute matching the dashboard's runtime.
  - Environments with custom ClickHouse metric table schemas may need to adjust this filter to query the correct Service Name and Resource Attributes columns.
  - For high-volume environments, filter load times can be reduced by [materializing](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/managing/performance_tuning#materialize-frequently-queried-attributes) the `ResourceAttributes['telemetry.sdk.language']` column.
- Templates reference up-to-date OTel Semantic Conventions when published, and are updated periodically as the OTel Spec is updated. For services instrumented with older OTel SDKs, the visualizations may need to be [edited](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/features/dashboards#dashboards-editing-visualizations) to reference older metric names.
